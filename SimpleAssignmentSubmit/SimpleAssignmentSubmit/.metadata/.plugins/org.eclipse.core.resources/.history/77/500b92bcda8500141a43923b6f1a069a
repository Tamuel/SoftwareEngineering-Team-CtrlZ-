/**
* The <code> AbstractServer </code> class maintains a thread that waits
* for connection attempts from clients. When a connection attempt occurs
* it creates a new <code> ConnectionToClient </code> instance which
* runs as a thread. When a client is thus connected to the
* server, the two programs can then exchange <code> Object </code>
* instances.<p>
